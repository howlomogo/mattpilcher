description: "<p>Nightmare Kid is a fast paced addictive shooter where you can use a mixture of upgrades and strategy to repel the ever increasing number of monsters and ghouls.</p>

<p>Your goal is to see how many nights you can survive and how many monsters you can destroy while doing so. But be careful at the end of each night is a much tougher boss.</p>

<p>Earn gold coins by killing the monsters and spend them on useful power ups and perks that will allow you to reach later nights.</p>

<p>How many nights can you survive?</p>

<p><i>The game is no longer available on the iOS store (due to costs), However I am able to show the game in person and may re release one day.</i></p>"
